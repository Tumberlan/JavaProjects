YOU LEFT ME FALLING AND LANDING INSIDE MY GRAVE 
I KNOW THAT YOU WANT ME DEAD

I KNOW IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD 
I HAVE THESE LUCID DREAMS WHERE I CAN'T MOVE A THING 
THINKING OF YOU IN MY BED 
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING 
THOUGHTS OF A WEDDING RING 
NOW I'M JUST BETTER OFF DEAD (UH, UH, UH) 
I'LL DO IT OVER AGAIN 
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END 
I WATCH IT BLOW IN THE WIND 
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO MY FRIENDS 
LEAVE THIS SHIT IN THE PAST, BUT I WANT IT TO LAST 
YOU WERE MADE OUTTA PLASTIC, FAKE 
I WAS TANGLED UP IN YOUR DRASTIC WAYS 
WHO KNEW EVIL GIRLS HAD THE PRETTIEST FACE? 
YOU GAVE ME A HEART THAT WAS FULL OF MISTAKES 
I GAVE YOU MY HEART AND YOU MADE HEARTBREAK
